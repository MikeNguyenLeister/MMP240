          <h3>Multimedia Programming and Design (A.S.)</h3>
          <p><strong>The Multimedia Programming and Design Program</strong> prepares students for careers in a variety of multimedia industries, companies and institutions that develop, produce or market multimedia products, programs or services. The program instructs students in the design and programming of computer-based interactive products that incorporate text, graphics, sound, animation and video. It also develops different types of talent, both creative and technical, with the imperative that each <em>understands</em> the work of the other so that they can collaborate effectively.</p> 
          <p>Upon successful completion of the curriculum, students are awarded an <strong>Associate in Science degree (A.S.)</strong> and may transfer to senior institutions such as <i>York</i>, <i>NYU</i> or <i>New York City College of Technology</i>.</p>

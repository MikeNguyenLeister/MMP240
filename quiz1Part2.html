              <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

This HTML file contains three DIVs with a paragraph inside each one of them. Without CSS they are stacked vertically.

    Use the CSS float property to arrange the divs as columns (type the css inside the STYLE element in the HEAD). Hint: one css declaration is sufficient.
    Create another version in which you use the CSS display property, with the value flex to arrange the divs as columns. Hint: one line of CSS is enough.----->
